# Ohanzee Helpers

This package contains a collection of helper components. These helpers are static
classes that are completely stateless and have no dependencies.

## Ohanzee Components by Kohana

Ohanzee is a set of PHP components that are [dependency free][1], [PSR compatible][2],
and [well documented][3]. The design is guided by [SOLID][4], [DRY][5], and [KISS][6]
(the [SDK][7]) philosophies.

Many were originally part of the [Kohana PHP Framework][8].
